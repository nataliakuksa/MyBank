# MyBank
A three tiered implementation of a simple bank simulation

This project exists to show a tiered application in action. It can help those who seek to learn the basics of how to build tiered applications by providing an example. I built it in order to practice putting together the skills I have learned in this regard. This bank simulation shows how to build an application with accouonts, login information, and balances. It also allows people to see how these are interconnected and how the data is stored in a non-relational database.

Installation Guidelines: In order to install this program, pull the data with git pull and then install locally with npm init.
